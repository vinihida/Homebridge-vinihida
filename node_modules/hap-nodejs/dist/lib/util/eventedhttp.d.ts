/**
 * EventedHTTPServer provides an HTTP-like server that supports HAP "extensions" for security and events.
 *
 * Implementation
 * --------------
 * In order to implement the "custom HTTP" server required by the HAP protocol (see HAPServer.js) without completely
 * reinventing the wheel, we create both a generic TCP socket server and a standard Node HTTP server.
 * The TCP socket server acts as a proxy, allowing users of this class to transform data (for encryption) as necessary
 * and passing through bytes directly to the HTTP server for processing. This way we get Node to do all
 * the "heavy lifting" of HTTP like parsing headers and formatting responses.
 *
 * Events are sent by simply waiting for current HTTP traffic to subside and then sending a custom response packet
 * directly down the wire via the socket.
 *
 * Each connection to the main TCP server gets its own internal HTTP server, so we can track ongoing requests/responses
 * for safe event insertion.
